      <h2><em>Where We are Now</em></h2>
        	<p>Our team members are currently in <b>Weh Island</b> (Aceh), <b>Jakarta</b>, <b>Bogor</b> (West Java), and <b>St Andrews</b> (Scotland).
          <p>Our study areas are where the opportunistic sightings and strandings of whale shark reported in Indonesian waters. In the western part of Indonesia we will conduct a study in Weh Island, Aceh, and Probolinggo, East Java. Talisayan in East Kalimantan, and Parigi in Central Sulawesi will represent the data for the central part of Indonesia, while the previous work (by some of our team members) in Cenderawasih Bay in West Papua will do the eastern part.<p>

        	<br>
          <p>In Weh Island, Probolinggo and Parigi, whale shark aggregations have attracted tourists and possibly trigger the growth of tourism-related activities there. Meanwhile in Talisayan, the local government has been promoting their whale shark tourism since 2014. We hope our study in Talisayan and other study areas will provide more strong scientific based recommendations for the growth of sustainable and responsible tourism.

            <h2><em>Research Methods</em></h2>
      	<p>In each location, we will conduct two months intensive survey. We considered we can do socialization and gather enough biological, ecological, environmental and social data/information in 2months period. The selection of survey period was based on anecdotal information collected for whale shark sighting period from every location. Survey will be carried out in August-September (Weh Island), October-November (Talisayan), December-January (Parigi) and February-March (Probolinggo). </p>
<p>The daily survey consists of mapping of whale shark foraging area, individual identification through Photo ID, plankton study and genetic sampling. Mapping of foraging area will be conducted through GPS tracking using a small boat in location where whale sharks are usually sighted. Tracking and sighting data will then be presented in maps. Once we encounter a whale shark, we record the coordinate and do Photo ID. Photo ID is an identification method using underwater camera based on unique white spot patterns from t he fifth gill to the tip of pectoral fin on left and right side of the body (Pierce, 2007). When the visibility is bad, we inject Radio Frequency Identification (RFID-permanent marker which works like barcode) and scan the whale shark to identify different individual. We also estimate size and sex and record other special remarks (scars, etc). </p>
<p>For plankton study, we collect water samples in each whale shark encounter spot with 3 replications. Water samples are then preserved using lugol and will be further analyzed in the laboratory to know plankton density and diversity in each location. </p>
<p>We collect piece of the dorsal fin from each individual whale shark encountered. Samples are then preserved in ethanol. The process of sample extraction, PCR and DNA Barcoding will be conducted in the laboratory. </p>
<p>During our survey, we will conduct interview or gather information from local community and authorities about their belief and value for whale shark. By doing this interview, we will also be able to identify if there is any kind of threat to whale shark population in each location. From every interview, there will be guided by and recorded in a questionnaire. </p>
<p>Before doing the survey, we will do an audience to local stakeholders, explaining what, where, when, why and how we do the survey. We will carry out a pre-test about whale shark during the first socialization. After the survey, data analysis and report writing, we will facilitate a workshop to present our study results and distributing information media (poster/leaflet). After the workshop, we will conduct post-test to see if there is any improvement regarding whale shark knowledge and awareness. </p>
<p>We will train representatives from local community to conduct daily monitoring (mapping of whale sharkencounter and Photo ID). They will taught about how to use GPS and underwater camera, collect Photo IDand fill and keep the data sheets. The regular monitoring will be facilitated by WSIP fund and other source of funding. Meanwhile, we also collect and record whale shark sighting and stranding events.</p>
