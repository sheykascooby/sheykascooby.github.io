      <h2><em>Who We Are</em></h2>
	<p>Funded by Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP) 2015 Future Conservation Award and in collaboration with Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) Republic of Indonesia, Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), and WWF-Indonesia, we organize trainings for local people to increase their expertise in monitoring whale shark population in their own area. 
We will work closely with local stakeholders, mainly from Center for Regional office of Coastal and Marine Resource (CRCMR), whose main obligation is to conduct survey on protected marine species, and local universities to ensure knowledge transfer and continuation of the program at local level. In Aceh, we will work with Padang CRCMR and University of Syiah Kuala. In Probolinggo, we will work with Denpasar CRCMR and Brawijaya University. In Talisayan, we will work together with Balikpapan CRCMR and Mulawarwan University. Lastly, in Parigi, we will work with Makassar CRCMR, Sam Ratulangi University and local dive resort (Parigi Mountong Resort).</p>

	<p>Through a variety of media, we also raise awareness on the importance of protecting whale sharks and respecting the marine environment.</p>
	
	 
            <h2><em>Why We Do</em></h2>
      	<p>Whale shark, the largest fish in the world, has been listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In Indonesia, the growing public interest of whale shark was triggered by the discovery of whale shark affiliation with lift-net fisheries in Cenderawasih Bay, Papua, in 2006. The preliminary study that was conducted there had become one foundation for Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) Republic of Indonesia to declare whale shark as a fully protected fish in Indonesia by May 2013. However, there are still very few studies about whale shark in Indonesia despite its current status and large size.</p>
      	
      
        
            <h2><em>What We Do</em></h2>
      	<p>Some of our team members have worked with whale sharks in Cenderawasih Bay, West Papua, during 2013-2014. Based on the successful experience, we plan to expand our study by conducting and facilitate a whale shark study and conservation during 2015-2016 in four important sites where whale sharks have been sighted regularly; Weh Island (Aceh), Probolinggo (East Java), Talisayan (East Kalimantan) and Parigi (Central Sulawesi). You can click here to see more information about the on-going study.</p>
	<p>Together with local stakeholders, we will conduct preliminary monitoring (individual identification and water quality measurement), facilitate monitoring training, and gather information as much as possible about whale shark sightings and stranding events in Indonesian waters. All information will be published here eventually as the website was also planned to be an online database which is accessible for everyone who is interested. These efforts hopefully will be the embryo for the birth of the Whale Shark Research Centre in Indonesia.
